            My name is Emelia and I am a 23 year old Interactive Media
            Technology master student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology,
            Sweden. I’m passionate about creating UX/UI design, web development
            and information visualization.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve had the opportunity to work on a number of instructive projects
            during my time at KTH. I hope you’ll enjoy viewing my projects as
            much as I enjoyed working on them.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also work part time at SAS Scandinavian Airlines. My work is
            focused around the Business Analyst Team at the Customer Service
            department. Due to the nature of my role at SAS many of the projects
            I've worked on since 2018 are confidential. Consequently, I can't
            publicly share my best work from the past years at SAS.

            The Customer Recovery and Liability department needed a deeper
            understanding of the claims, complaitnts and compliments submitted
            to SAS. The only data available previously were the current queue
            status.
          </p>
          <p>
            This interactive tool gives the them the possibility to look at
            several corralations, analyze trends and follow up on categories,
            teams or sites. The dashboard uses Microsoft's Power Bi and data is
            exctracted and processed from the database with SQL. All visuals are
            interactive and connected to each other with create endless
            possibilities to explore the data.
          </p>

          <p>Some exampleas of what can be viewed in the dasboard are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Corralation between the amount of working agents and closed cases.
            </li>
            <li>
              More in depth follow up on productivity, eg. the amount of emails
              sent, amount of expected and unexpected return emails from
              customers.
            </li>
            <li>Better understanding of the KPIs.</li>
            <li>Further information of the queue status.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            With the help of this dashboard has the team changed a some routines
            for how to handle cases. The most significan is that they now
            primarly focuses on cases in the queue instead of return emails.
            This was changed after we discovered that a case can ususally be
            slolved with one email to the customer (our decision/reply) and only
            10% of the cases that has been marked as closed by an agent are
            reopened again.
